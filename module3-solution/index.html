                        <h3>Chicken</h3>
                         <p>
                             Chicken is the most common type poultry in the world. Owing to relative ease and low cost of raising them in comparison to animals such as cattle or hogs,chickens have become prevalent throughout the cuisine of cultures ground the world, and their meat has been variously adapted to regional tastes.
                             Chicken can be prepared in a vast range of ways, including baking, grilling, barbecuing, frying, and boiling, among many others, depending on its purpose. Since the latter half of the 20th century, prepared chicken has become a staple of fast food. Chicken is sometimes cited as being more healthful than red meat, with lower concentrations of cholesterol and saturated fat.[2]
                             The poultry farming industry that accounts for chicken production takes on a range of forms across different parts of the world. In developed countries, chickens are typically subject to intensive farming methods, while less-developed areas raise chickens using more traditional farming techniques. The United Nations estimates there to be 19 billion chickens on Earth today, making them outnumber humans more than two to one.[3

                        <h3>Chicken Tikka Masala</h3>
                             <p>
                             Chicken tikka masala is a dish of chunks of roasted marinated chicken in a spiced curry. Its origin is disputed. The curry is usually creamy and orange-coloured originating from the Indian subcontinent. It is among the United Kingdom's most popular dishes.
                             Chicken tikka masala[1] is composed of chicken tikka, boneless chunks of chicken marinated in spices and yogurt that are roasted in an oven, served in a creamy curry sauce.[2] A tomato and coriander sauce is common, but no recipe for chicken tikka masala is standard; a survey found that of 48 different recipes, the only common ingredient was chicken.[3][4] The sauce usually includes tomatoes (frequently as purée), cream, coconut cream and spices like many versions of its namesake masala spice mix. The sauce and chicken pieces may be coloured orange using foodstuffs such as turmeric, paprika, tomato purée or with food dye. The dish shares some similarity with butter chicken, both in the method of creation and appearance.
                             Variants of the dish replace chicken with other foodstuffs such as lamb, fish, paneer or mushrooms.

                             Barfi, borfi or burfi is a dense milk-based sweet from the Indian subcontinent, and a type of mithai. The name is a derivative of the Persian word barf, which means snow. A few of the famous varieties of barfi include besan barfi (made with gram flour), kaaju barfi (made with cashews), pista barfi (made with ground pistachios), and sing barfi(made with peanuts)
                             The flavour of a barfi is often enhanced with fruits (such as mango or coconut) or nuts (such as cashew, pistachio, or peanut) and spices (such as cardamom or rose water). Barfis are usually coated with a thin layer of edible metallic leaf known as vark. They are typically cut into square, diamond, or round shapes. The sweet is easily adapted for casual occasions to the most formal event. Different types of barfi vary in their colour and texture.
